Virtually all contracts will have to make an external call to an uncontrolled address at some point. When this happens, your contract loses execution control until the call returns. If the call is not read-only (`view` or `pure`), the called address is generally free to perform any state altering operations it wants, including further operations on your own contract(s). If you aren't anticipating this behavior, you may be vulnerable to a classic reentrancy attack.

## What is a Reentrancy Attack?
There are much better [guides](???) on reentrancy attacks from more security-focused resources, but let's briefly explain them for the uninitiated.

The anatomy of a classic reentrancy attack follows an external call that calls back into the calling contract ("reentered") in order to exploit some incomplete state.

In the broader definition, the contract and function being reentered don't have to be the same as in the initial operation. All that matters is that they depend on some shared state.


## Losing Execution Control

The way a contract typically loses execution control is through an external function call to another contract, so it may make sense to vet the contract being called to ensure it doesn't perform a reentrant call. But even if you do trust the contract being called, that contract may end up calling another contract that you *haven't* vetted. This has been an especially painful lesson since the rise of tokens that have receiver callbacks on transfer.

An extremely common, but less obvious, example of an external call that result in a loss of execution control is in the case of ETH transfers. ETH transfers (that aren't `selfdestruct`s) are accomplished through a naked function call, but the solidity language provides high-level `send()` and `transfer()` helpers to abstract the mechanism away, as do many other third-party libraries. So you should approach ETH transfers with the same caution as external calls.


## Normal


Smart contracts frequently (intentionally or unintentionally) have to interact with other contracts outside of the control of the author. Every call to a contract will result in a loss of execution One of the most common hacks in smart contracts center around reentrancy. At its core, reentrancy is about losing execution control

When contracts need to store arbitrary data they will usually declare a `bytes` or `string` storage variable and write to it. This uses contract storage, which is straightforward and intuitive but can become prohibitively expensive for larger data. Contract storage is slot-based, charging 20k gas per word (32 bytes) of data to initialize for the first time. To store 256 bytes this way would cost 160k gas.

But if you don't need the ability to change the data, there's a cheaper on-chain location to store arbitrary data that contracts can still access.


## Contract Bytecode
The bytecode for a contract also lives on-chain, in a separate code storage location. This location is intended to hold the contract's executable bytecode, along with any compile-time constants and `immutable` variables. But there is a way to store arbitrary data in this code storage location as well.

Unlike normal contract storage, data in code storage can only be set once, during contract initialization/creation. It is also limited to ~24KB. However, gas costs can be much lower when storing large data (several words). The cost to initialize data in code storage is a more complex formula and depends on your exact implementation, but you can roughly approximate it with:

```
total_cost = 32k + mem_expansion_cost + code_deposit_cost
mem_expansion_cost = size * 3 + (size ** 2) / 512
code_deposit_cost = 200 * size
```

So, to store 256 bytes of data in contract bytecode would cost only 84k, compared to the 160k for conventional contract storage, which is almost half the cost! The savings go up as the size of the data increases.

## How It Works
But how do we store arbitrary data (not code) in bytecode storage? During contract deployment, the constructor runs first. The constructor is part of a contract's initialization process, often setting up state variables. But what solidity abstracts away from you is that after the constructor runs, it also returns data that will make up the contract's permanent bytecode. This data is exactly what will get stored in the contract's code storage.

By dropping into assembly, you can preempt the compiler's built-in return to return whatever data you want stored in code storage. 

```solidity
contract StoreString {
    constructor(string memory s) {
        // Store the string in the contract's code storage.
        assembly {
            return(
                add(s, 0x20), // start of return data
                mload(s) // size of return data
            )
        }
    }
}
```

Afterwards, if you tried to access the deployed address' code data, you would get back the arbitrary data stored there. So to access that data again, you just need to remember the deployed address.

```solidity
address(new StoreString("hello, world")).code // "hello, world" 
```

## Preventing Accidental Execution
Even though the data you're storing in code storage with this method is probably not actual bytecode, the EVM can't tell the difference. So *any* calls to the address will attempt to execute the data stored there as bytecode, starting with the first byte. It is possible that a sequence of starting arbitrary bytes is, intentionally or unintentionally, valid bytecode and could cause some meaningful interaction if executed. For example, if the data started with `33FF`, anyone could call the contract and it would self-destruct, taking the data with it. For this reason, it's a good idea to prefix the data with something that causes execution to halt. The `00` byte is a good candidate because it is also the `STOP` opcode, which ends execution immediately, but `FE` (`INVALID`) also works well.

```solidity
contract StoreString {
    constructor(string memory s) {
        // Store the string in the contract's code storage.
        // Prefix with STOP opcode to prevent execution.
        bytes memory p = abi.encodePacked(hex"00", s);
        assembly {
            return(
                add(p, 0x20), // start of return data
                mload(p) // size of return data
            )
        }
    }
}
```

But don't forget to discard this prefix when reading the data back later!

## The Demo
The [demo](./OnChainPfp.sol) loosely implements an NFT which can be minted with a user-provided image that's stored permanently on-chain. The `mint()` function will trigger code storage of a base64-encoded PNG image. `tokenURI()` will later read the code data at the deployed address and will embed the image in the URI using [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) semantics.
