## Running The Example
- This project will attempt to build the root foundry project, so make sure you have foundry installed and configured beforehand (see the [main docs](../../../README.md)).
- You will need access to a mainnet provider URL and supply it via the `NODE_RPC` environment variable.

```bash
$> npm install
$> NODE_RPC=https://YOUR_MAINNET_NODE_RPC_URL npm start
DAI received from swap: 1706.737523852384280221
