# useful-solidity-patterns
---
This repo is an ongoing collection of useful and (sometimes) clever solidity patterns, many of which are used in the wild, ranging from basic to advanced, demonstrated with concise examples. I ([@merklejerk](https://github.com/merklejerk)) will be adding new patterns daily-weekly but contributions are absolutely welcome!

The code examples herein are meant to be educational. Most have not been audited and are not intended to be deployed as-is without an independent security review.

## Current Examples
- [Factory Proofs](./examples/factory-proofs)
    - Proving on-chain that a contract was deployed by a trusted deployer.
- [Explicit Storage Buckets](./examples/explicit-storage-buckets)
    - Safer, guaranteed non-overlapping storage for upgradeable contracts.
- Stay tuned for more ðŸ˜‰
